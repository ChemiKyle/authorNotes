# authorNotes

If you're anything like me you make highlights in your Kindle while reading as often as a confused 8th grader researching for a book report. Amazon stores these in a big .txt file on the device ordered by date, which isn't so great for finding out what specific lines Jane Austen said that made Mark Twain hate her so much.

[I made a web app](https://chemikyle.github.io/authorNotes/) to sort through your Kindle clippings and present them in a more manageable manner so you can more easily navigate them, and readily echo those funny things Dave Eggers said and try to pass yourself off as witty at dinner parties. Simply upload your "My Clippings.txt" file from your Kindle to the site and your highlights will be presented on the right page.  
Currently shown as a large scrollable file formatted by author and by book, but as I learn more I'll eventually add drop down menus for each author.
