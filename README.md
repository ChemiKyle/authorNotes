# authorNotes

I sometimes read books to help create an illusion of intelligence. I'm also really forgetful, so I don't remember details from books I've read. Obviously this is detrimental to the upkeep of my facade, leaving me to compensate by using florid language and portraying a perniciously pretentious personality (haha, I made a meta joke, plz like me).  
Like any confused 8th grader researching a book report, I highlight parts I particularly enjoy as I go along; occasionally I'll go back and read one of my highlights and remember large portions of the book. Thankfully Amazon stores these as a .txt file on the device, so I'm able to take them off and separate them into authors for easy rememberance.

[I made a web app](https://chemikyle.github.io/authorNotes/) to sort through your Kindle clippings and present them in a more manageable manner. Simply upload your "My Clippings.txt" file from your Kindle to the site and your highlights will be presented on the right page.  
Currently shown as a large scrollable file formatted by author and by book, but as I learn more I'll eventually add drop down menus for each author.
