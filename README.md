# authorNotes
I sometimes read books to help create an illusion of intelligence. I'm also really forgetful, so I don't remember details from books I've read. Obviously this is detrimental to the upkeep of my facade, leaving me to compensate by using florid language and portraying a perniciously pretentious personality (haha, look, it's a meta joke! plz like me).  
Like any confused 8th grader researching a book report, I highlight parts I particularly enjoy as I go along; occasionally I'll go back and read one of my highlights and remember large portions of the book. Thankfully Amazon stores these as a .txt file on the device, so I'm able to take them off and separate them into authors for easy rememberance.

The bash script copies notes from your kindle on to your computer.  
The python script takes highlights/notes from your kindle clippings and separates them into text files for each author.

This should work for anything that runs bash by default, I've only tested on Debian-based Linux though.

TODO: Format the quotes into a SQL database by author and book, so I can display them on my dashboard and not relieve my amnesia of the same book two days in a row.

Sample output for Kurt Vonnegut: kurtVonnegutNotes.txt

I'm currently making this into a webapp, the scripts will function as normal if you stumble on this and want to use it in your own computer.
