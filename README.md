# authorNotes
Takes highlights/notes from kindle your clippings and separates them into text files for each author.

The bash script should work for anything that runs bash by default, I've only tested on Debian-based Linux though.
You'll need to copy the file "My Clippings.txt" from your kindle to the folder containing the script, here I have "My Clippings.txt" renamed to kindleNotes.txt.

Sample output for Kurt Vonnegut: kurtVonnegutNotes.txt
